    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>Personal History</h3>
    <p>Hey everyone, My name is Nicholas and I am from Cornelius, Oregon. It is a small town about 40 minutes west of Portland.
        I was born in Eastern Oregon in a smaller town called Pendleton but have lived in Cornelius ever since I was 4 or 5 years old.
        I am the oldest of 5 kids, I have 3 younger brothers and a younger sister. The second oldest is on a mission in Layton, Utah and 
        everyone else still lives in Oregon.

    </p>

    <h3>Recent History</h3>
    <p>I am married to my beautiful wife, Emma. We have been married for just over a year and I absolutely love being married to my best
        friend. We met on our missions in Tucson, AZ. I was originally called to Porto Alegre, Brasil and I served in Brasil for 8 months
        until covid hit and I got reassigned to Tucson. I currently have a job doing phone sales for a company named squeeze where I cold
        call people about debt consolidation. It is a decent job that makes good money, but definitely something I don't want to do with my
        life, hence I am taking this course.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are playing basketball, pickleball, and learning new things. One thing I am trying to learn is how to play chess.
        Turns out I am aweful at chess but I can still whoop my litte brother which is all that matters. I also enjoy learning to code both 
        in HTML and Python. In my free time, I sometimes will read books, do puzzles, or play the Nintendo Switch. Together, my wife and I 
        like to go on walks, binge TV shows, and play mario games on our switch together.
